# She is strong source

This is the source for the [SheIsStrong](http://www.sheisstrong.org) website. I should have done it in branches but I messed up and for now this flow isn't terrible.

Build with `hugo -t hugo-agency-theme` and the copy the .git from the previous public folder and push from there.
